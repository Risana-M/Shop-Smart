 Description-->
FreshCo is a modern e-commerce platform dedicated to bringing organic, farm-fresh vegetables and fruits directly to consumers. The application features a seamless shopping experience with real-time filtering, a persistent wishlist, and a responsive shopping cart.

 Features-->
Product Filtering: Advanced filtering by category, price range, and ratings.

Dynamic Wishlist: Save your favorite items to a "maybe later" list with Redux persistence.

Responsive Shopping Cart: Manage quantities and view real-time price totals.

Quick View: Modal-based product previews for faster browsing.

Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience across Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), and Ultra-wide Desktop (1920px).

 Project Goals-->
The aim of this project was to master State Management using Redux Toolkit and to implement a Mobile-First responsive architecture using Tailwind CSS. I focused on handling complex UI logic like cross-slice interactions (moving items from Wishlist to Cart).

 Technologies Used-->
Frontend: React.js

State Management: Redux Toolkit

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Mobile-First approach)

Routing: React Router v6

Deployment: [Vercel / Netlify]

 Responsive Design-->
This application is fully responsive and tested on:

Mobile (375px): Single-column layouts and stacked cart items for thumb-friendly navigation.

Tablets (768px): Grid layouts for product browsing.

Desktop (1920px): Contained 1600px width with centered layouts to prevent content stretching.

 Design Choices
Color Palette: Used Emerald and Green hues to reinforce the "organic and fresh" brand identity.

Spacing: Implemented large gaps and rounded-2xl corners for a soft, modern e-commerce feel.

UX: Chose a horizontal scroll for "Deals" on the home page to save vertical space on mobile devices.

 Future Enhancements-->
User Authentication: Login/Sign-up using Firebase.

Stripe Integration: Real payment processing.

Admin Dashboard: To add/edit product stock in real-time.
